    Showing me the parts of the code that weren't equal

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    You could see were are the errors and know how to fix them

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    A pro is that you can submit a solution that works instead of submiting something that can even compile. A con is that you can get larger versions of changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It depends in the purpose of the file. If you edit a Google Doc, it is not going to alter another file. If you are coding and you change the functionality you might need to alter another code so the program could work

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git diff you can see the differences between two commits and with git log you can see all the commits made with their comments

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
